## Redis FullText Search

Build a Search App with Redis & Next.js.

### Usage

```
git clone <this-repo>
npm install
```

This demo requires that you have a Redis database(with RedisJSON and RediSearch modules) running in the cloud or locally. Create a file named `.env.local` and export `REDIS_URL` with your connection details. Example:

```
REDIS_URL=redis://default:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT
```
